# Flutter Multi-BLoC App with Clean Architecture

This Flutter app demonstrates how to manage multiple BLoC (Business Logic Component) instances using clean architecture principles. The app features reusable and modular widgets, state management with BLoC, and a simple UI to navigate between different screens like days and months, incrementing or decrementing them based on button presses.

## Getting Started
-Day Counter: A simple counter for the days of the week (Sunday to Saturday).

-Month Counter: A simple counter for the months of the year (January to December).

-Clean Architecture: The app follows a clean and maintainable architecture, separating concerns into layers such as presentation, business logic, and data.

-Multiple BLoCs: The app showcases how to use multiple BLoCs to manage different parts of the state and logic independently.

-Reusable Widgets: The app contains modular widgets such as CustomButton, CustomText, CommonAppBar and ohters, making the UI components reusable across different screens.

-Separation of Concerns: The app ensures that the UI (widgets) is separate from the business logic (BLoCs).
